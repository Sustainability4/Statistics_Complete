# Statistics
Branch of mathametics that involve collecting and analyzing data in large quantities so that one can come up with solving various use cases and one can obtain meaningful information. Statistics is mainly of two types : Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statitics. In descriptive statics we mostly try to understand the data basically visualize the data or doing EDA. In inferential statistics we take a sample of the data from a population, perform some experiment and come up with some conclusions. 

## Descriptive Statitics 
Histograms, Bar Graphs, Pie Graphs, Scatter Plots

Libraries : Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly 
Tools : Power BI, Spotfire

## Inferential Statistics
Uses the data to make some conclusions. For e.g Hypothesis Testing (P-value, F-Test, Chi Square test, Z-Test)

## Population and Sample 
In a machine learning problem statement we always have a sample of data. We rarely get the complete population of the data and hence we need to understand the sample formation. Also in train-test split we may do various splits. We can do random split, cross-validation splits, clustering split, etc. Sample is a representative subset of the population which is used for analysis of the population. Sampling technique is very important when talking about the conclusion from the sample about the population. There are various sampling methods : 
1. Random Sampling : Whenever one chooses the samples they randomly get selected.
2. Stratified Sampling : Population is divided into stratas. For e.g Refineries based on configuration, sample based on gender
3. Systematic Sampling : In a systematics sampling one can start somewhere and then choose every third person or every 2nd person or can follow any rule/system. It might be a case that system is not recused bias. 
4. Clustering Sampling : Doing a survey on set of groups or clusters. This usage is very handy in customer segmentation , for e.g in defining promotional activities based on expenditure. Here we wpould target different clusters of customers.
